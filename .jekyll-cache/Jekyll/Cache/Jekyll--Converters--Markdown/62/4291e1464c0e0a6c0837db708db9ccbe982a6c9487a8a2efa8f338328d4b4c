I"Š<p>At this point, I have a bunch of blogs scattered across the world wide web. I used to think blogging is all about writing â€œdiary entriesâ€, sort of like the readersâ€™ window into your life. But apparently, it can be so much more than that.</p>

<p>If youâ€™ve somehow managed to stumble upon my previous blog(s)â€“whichever it is. You probably notice that I sort of lost my blogging â€˜themeâ€™ as the line between my work and life experiences are getting blurry. Sometimes Iâ€™ll ramble about generic stuff (like sharing my view about women in STEM, etc.), but other times I want to talk about a concept of a certain computer science topic that Iâ€™m interested in (for no reason whatsoever).</p>

<p>So I guess, hereâ€™s to a new start. To a(nother) new blog, which Iâ€™ll try my best to keep it updated. And yes, I forgot to write a welcome message in the beginning of this blogpost, so Iâ€™m going to do it now.</p>

<div class="language-swift highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">let</span> <span class="nv">message</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">"Welcome!"</span>
<span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">message</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">//=&gt; prints 'Welcome!' to console.</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Yeah, that was me flexing. Hope you have a good timeâ€¦ exploring (?)</p>
