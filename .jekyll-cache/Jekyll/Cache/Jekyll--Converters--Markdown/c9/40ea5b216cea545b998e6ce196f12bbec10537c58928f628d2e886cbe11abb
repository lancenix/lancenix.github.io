I"‹<p>Just a bit of disclaimer, I‚Äôm not an expert in this field. This is simply me sharing what I know about the matter. I just found out about this around February this year, because my professor sort of ‚Äòchallenged‚Äô my friends and I on making a hologram game. We didn‚Äôt really know how to simply make a hologram game, let alone projecting a simple hologram. So we did a little digging into the good ol‚Äô Google Search and found out a method called ‚ÄúIntegral Photography‚Äù or Integral Imaging, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_imaging">Wikipedia</a> called it.</p>

<p>The definition Wikipedia gives, still makes no sense for me. Then again, I barely understand half of the jargons written in there, but here‚Äôs what I can understand so far: Integral imaging is an imaging technique that enables people to see 2D stuff on screen as 3D when projected and viewed at certain angles. The original Integral Imaging technique uses what‚Äôs called the ‚ÄúFly‚Äôs eyes lens‚Äù, don‚Äôt really know where you could get that. This type of lens, when lined up can translates a 3D object into 2D and re-project that 3D object.</p>

<p>But, just re-projecting a 3D object into a screen doesn‚Äôt make it a hologram. We need what is called Autostereoscopic display (I know, that‚Äôs a mouthful). This type of display allows users to see dimensions and depth of objects inside their screen. Here‚Äôs a visualization to get you started:</p>

<p>Which reminds me of that old 2002 iMac G4 display which follows your sight or whatever. Yeah, kind of like that but instead of the screen, it‚Äôs the images inside the screen.</p>

<p>So how do you build a display like this? Well, financially speaking it‚Äôs going to be expensive as heck. Reason? A circle has 360 kind of angles, and that‚Äôs just on one 2D plane. Combine that into a ball to make the perfect, Iron Man movie-grade kind of hologram? I don‚Äôt know, abundance, you get the idea. To be able to project a 3D object like that‚Ä¶ well, it takes a lot. So instead of wasting away thinking about how to create a display like that and revolutionize an entire tech industry, you just simply have to limit the angles.</p>

<p>Sucks, yeah, but in this project I mainly want to focus on trying to finish the game side, not trying to create a breakthrough in the fields of computer vision or something, I don‚Äôt know. So restricting the amount of angles sounds like a good deal for me.</p>

<p>How many angles then? Good question. The answer is: it depends. Depends on what kind of 3D shaped object you can easily recreate. So in my case, I went back and did some Googling on the matter. After two days worth of 24/7 running Chrome with 50 something opened tabs on my laptop, I found this <a href="http://avestia.com/EECSS2016_Proceedings/files/paper/MHCI/109.pdf">blessed piece of conference paper that just shatters my heart and soul, making my eyes watery with tears of happiness</a>. I simply read the title, bookmarked it, and slammed my body onto my bed, because I survived on 2 hours of sleep every night ever since this project started.</p>
