<p>At this point, I have a bunch of blogs scattered across the world wide web. I used to think blogging is all about writing “diary entries”, sort of like the readers’ window into your life. But apparently, it can be so much more than that.</p>

<p>If you’ve somehow managed to stumble upon my previous blog(s)–whichever it is. You probably notice that I sort of lost my blogging ‘theme’ as the line between my work and life experiences are getting blurry. Sometimes I’ll ramble about generic stuff (like sharing my view about women in STEM, etc.), but other times I want to talk about a concept of a certain computer science topic that I’m interested in (for no reason whatsoever).</p>

<p>So I guess, here’s to a new start. To a(nother) new blog, which I’ll try my best to keep it updated. And yes, I forgot to write a welcome message in the beginning of this blogpost, so I’m going to do it now.</p>

<div class="language-swift highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">let</span> <span class="nv">message</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">"Welcome!"</span>
<span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">message</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">//=&gt; prints 'Welcome!' to console.</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Hope you have a good time… exploring (?)</p>
