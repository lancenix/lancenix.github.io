I" <p>Just a bit of disclaimer, Iâ€™m not an expert in this field. This is simply me sharing what I know about the matter. I just found out about this around February this year, because my professor sort of â€˜challengedâ€™ my friends and I on making a hologram game. We didnâ€™t really know how to simply make a hologram game, let alone projecting a simple hologram. So we did a little digging into the good olâ€™ Google Search and found out a method called â€œIntegral Photographyâ€ or Integral Imaging, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_imaging">Wikipedia</a> called it.</p>

<p>The definition Wikipedia gives, still makes no sense for me. Then again, I barely understand half of the jargons written in there, but hereâ€™s what I can understand so far: Integral imaging is an imaging technique that enables people to see 2D stuff on screen as 3D when projected and viewed at certain angles. The original Integral Imaging technique uses whatâ€™s called the â€œFlyâ€™s eyes lensâ€, donâ€™t really know where you could get that. This type of lens, when lined up can translates a 3D object into 2D and re-project that 3D object.</p>

<p>But, just re-projecting a 3D object into a screen doesnâ€™t make it a hologram. We need what is called Autostereoscopic display (I know, thatâ€™s a mouthful). This type of display allows users to see dimensions and depth of objects inside their screen at angles. Hereâ€™s a visualization to get you started:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/integral-imaging/display.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Which reminds me of that old 2002 iMac G4 display which follows your sight or whatever. Yeah, kind of like that but instead of the screen, itâ€™s the images inside the screen that â€˜followsâ€™ you.</p>

<p>So how do you build a display like this? Well, financially speaking itâ€™s going to be expensive as heck. Reason? A circle has 360 kind of angles, and thatâ€™s just on one 2D plane. Combine that into a ball to make the perfect, Iron Man movie-grade kind of hologram? I donâ€™t know, abundance, you get the idea. To be able to project a 3D object like thatâ€¦ well, it takes a lot. So instead of wasting away thinking about how to create a display like that and revolutionize an entire tech industry, you just simply have to limit the angles.</p>

<p>Sucks, yeah, but in this project I mainly want to focus on trying to finish the game side, not trying to create a breakthrough in the fields of computer vision or something, I donâ€™t know. So restricting the amount of angles sounds like a good deal for me.</p>

<p>How many angles then? Good question. The answer is: it depends. Depends on what kind of 3D shaped object you can easily recreate. So in my case, I went back and did some Googling on the matter. After two days worth of 24/7 running Chrome with 50-something active tabs on my laptop, I found this <a href="http://avestia.com/EECSS2016_Proceedings/files/paper/MHCI/109.pdf">blessed piece of conference paper that just shatters my heart and soul, making my eyes watery with tears of happiness</a>. I simply read the title, bookmarked it, and slammed my body onto my bed, because I survived on 2 hours of sleep every night ever since this project started.</p>

<p>So, creating a square-based pyramid shaped objectâ€“*X-Files theme song playing in the backgroundâ€“* is not entirely impossible. It is manageable and not an out-of-this-world concept to begin with. Itâ€™s solid. But with what material?</p>

<p>Coming from what we already know about Integral Imaging, we simply donâ€™t need to translate a 3D object into a 2D plane. Any 3D game engine already does that for you. So what we need is a <strong>projector</strong> that will â€˜re-projectâ€™ those 3D game scenes you see in your screen. Okay great, a projector. I read through more papers before deciding and apparently the best materials are between something glossy and obviously clear-colored (is â€˜clearâ€™ a color (?)). Plexiglass/acrylic is among the most used material in this case.</p>

<p>The dimensions of the acrylic will solely depend on the screen youâ€™re going to use as the projection source and the size of the â€˜imagesâ€™ you want to project. Just make sure, since itâ€™s a square-based pyramid, youâ€™ll going to need 4 2D planes as well (better in four different angles as well) so it can be projected and created this so-called one 3D object which can be seen on all four sides of the pyramid! Something like this:</p>

<p>Credit goes to my friend for creating this model to be used in a thesis weâ€™re writing together. So youâ€™ll get something like this: (look mom, I made something cool)</p>
