<h2>My works</h2>
<p>This platform exists as a way for me to share ideas or concepts that interest me, this can also act as a way to document my learning progress. 
	I spent a lot of my time working on side projects, I feel like there's a lot to be shared along the way. Here's an overview of things I used to do or I'm currently tinkering on:</p>

	<h3>Electronics</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>LED Visualizer based on music volume and pitch</li>
		<li>Hologram projector using integral imaging method</li>
		<li>Trying my best to not blow things up, I'm still a newbie on these things.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Software Development</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>iOS development</li>

<h2>Recent projects</h2>
<p>I did projects in random area, although it's mostly game development. I like teaching myself and trying new things out. I'm currently planning on doing projects about electronics/hardware and anything related to machine learning.</p>
<div class="aboutme">
	<ul class="recent">
		{% for project in site.projects %}
	    	<li><a href="{{ project.url}}"><h3 class="project-name" itemprop="name">{{ project.name }}</h3></a></li>
	    {% endfor %}
	</ul>
